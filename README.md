Increase your emotional happiness through technology you already use

Suppose you telephone a friend who fails to return your call after a reasonable time. You then feel depressed when you tell yourself that your friend probably got the message but wasn't interested enough to call you back. Your distortion? Mind reading. You then feel bitter, and decide not to call back and check this out because you say to yourself, "He'll think I'm being obnoxious if I call him back again. I'll only make a fool of myself.". Because of these negative predictions (the fortune teller error), you avoid your friend and feel put down. Three weeks later you learn that you friend never got your message. All that stewing, it rums out, was just a lot of self-imposed hokum.

## My examples

My father calls me during the week (in terms of frequency of calls he does it maybe once a month) and I don't hear the phone ringing. When I see he called me I assume something bad must have happened with my mother otherwise why would he call at this time. My error? Mind reading and catastrophizing. I start feeling anxious about what has happened and when he doesn't answer me back I feel like this is a confirmation that something bad has happened and it's just a matter of time before I find out some bad news and I will feel awful about it.

I call a friend and he is in car. Due to network connection issues I cannot hear him anymore and the call is dropped. I then think whether the car crashed and something has happened with him.

My sister fails to respond to a call when she is in another country and I assume something bad must have happened if she doesn't respond.

## Is this application appropriate for me?

Did you ever feel queasy when one of your parents haven't responded to your calls?

Did you ever wonder why someone isn't answering?

Did you ever think something bad must have happened if they haven't answered the phone?

Did you wonder why someone is not calling you back and what's going on with them because they haven't answered?

## After completion the application should compute a score to decide what we should show the user.

For example we can compute a tranquillity score, an anxiety score, etc. Our purpose is to see whether the dychotomy of control can be understood.

##

You start off small until you can actively say you are not afraid or the thought ...

They call you at random hours.

## You make a call

It tells you the person might not respond and it's outside of your control.

The person is not answering.

You are being told it's outside of you control whether they answer or not. They could be busy (10-18) or they might ran out of battery or ...

In time you increase the toughness of the messages for example: They might not want to talk to you. Did you upset them recently? It's outside of your control how they feel.

#### Customer Hypothesis

People who've had an anxious episode and have been at least one time to a psychologist or psychiatrist

#### Problem Hypothesis

Don't know about thinking errors they make everyday and how to correct them to improve their emotional well-being

#### Design Experiments

- I am willing to accept mental health issues are solvable from within
- I am willing to set aside time every day to work on my mental fitness
- I understand that by working every day to improve mental fitness I improve my emotional well-being
- I accept it takes time to change your mind and don't expect instant gratification
- I am able to learn cognitive distortions related to my condition (anxiety or depression)
- I am able to identify the cognitive distortions making a thought
- I am able to identify that the thought is distorted
- I am able to identify between subjectivity and objectivity
- people are able to identify automatic thoughts
- people are able to correct distorted thoughts
- But because no shortage of adversity is ever likely to occur, to be successful in the long term such a thought-stopping strategy would require us to monitor ourselves continuously and indefinitely, a proposition far too exhausting for most of us.
