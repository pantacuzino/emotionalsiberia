Increase your emotional happiness through technology you already use

Did you ever feel queasy when one of your parents haven't responded to your calls?

Did you ever wonder why someone isn't answering?

Did you ever think something bad must have happened if they haven't answered the phone?

Did you wonder why someone is not calling you back and what's going on with them because they haven't answered?
