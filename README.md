Increase your emotional happiness through technology you already use

Suppose you telephone a friend who fails to return your call after a reasonable time. You then feel depressed when you tell yourself that your friend probably got the message but wasn't interested enough to call you back. Your distortion? Mind reading. You then feel bitter, and decide not to call back and check this out because you say to yourself, "He'll think I'm being obnoxious if I call him back again. I'll only make a fool of myself.". Because of these negative predictions (the fortune teller error), you avoid your friend and feel put down. Three weeks later you learn that you friend never got your message. All that stewing, it rums out, was just a lot of self-imposed hokum.

## Is this application appropriate for me?

Did you ever feel queasy when one of your parents haven't responded to your calls?

Did you ever wonder why someone isn't answering?

Did you ever think something bad must have happened if they haven't answered the phone?

Did you wonder why someone is not calling you back and what's going on with them because they haven't answered?

## After completion the application should compute a score to decide what we should show the user.

For example we can compute a tranquillity score, an anxiety score, etc. Our purpose is to see whether the dychotomy of control can be understood.

##

You start off small until you can actively say you are not afraid or the thought ...

They call you at random hours.

## You make a call

It tells you the person might not respond and it's outside of your control.

The person is not answering.

You are being told it's outside of you control whether they answer or not. They could be busy (10-18) or they might ran out of battery or ...

In time you increase the toughness of the messages for example: They might not want to talk to you. Did you upset them recently? It's outside of your control how they feel.
